# An all-in-one starter pack

A Vue ðŸ’š production ready ðŸ¤© template for building bleeding edge ðŸ˜Ž web apps for all platforms ðŸŒŸ. Has [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com) ðŸ“± and [Tauri](https://tauri.app) ðŸ’» pre-configured and setup.

## New in V2 :

-   Upgrade to Vue 3.4 and enable `props-destructure`.
-   Upgrade to Vite 5 and update dependencies.
-   Move to unlugin-vue-router for file based routing(From the author of Vue-router).
-   File based routing that works with Ionic Router, which adds transition between pages and back button navigation on mobile.
-   Use `vite-tsconfig-paths` for vite paths.
-   Update all scripts and project to use ESM.
-   Add auto-import with unplugin-auto-import - All vue exports, Vue router exports.
-   Clean up code, remove un-needed dependencies and use better standards.

### Planned for Later in V2:

-   Update UnoCSS to Tailwind v4(To benefit from Oxide Complier and other updates).

## Why use this template ?

-   You might don't want to go through the hassle of setting up linter, formatter, router, store etc and still want the [latest vue].
-   If you use the ionic components as your base for components, in future you can build your web app as an android or ios app with Capacitor ( I feel it is better for mobile than other vue component libraries).
-   File structure based routing and UnoCSS for atomic css.
-   Capacitor is present for mobile and Tauri for desktops.
-   Eslint for linting and prettier for formatting files ( and yes both work combined without issues ).
-   Husky is setup and is being used for commit linting.
-   Vite is used for superior dev experience.
-   Setup so that VS Code suggests all needed extensions for a good dev experience.
-   Live servers with `dev-ios`, `dev-android` & `dev-tauri` for easier dev experience.
